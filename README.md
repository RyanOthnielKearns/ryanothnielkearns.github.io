I'm a student at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk).

Previously, I studied [Philosophy](https://philosophy.stanford.edu) (BAH) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.stanford.edu) (BS) at Stanford University. I wrote a [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08900) about trustâ€”what it is, philosophically, and what is required for a philosophically defensible account of trust in explainable AI literature.

I also worked at [Monte Carlo Data](https://www.montecarlodata.com) as a Founding Data Scientist, did [NLP research](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.317/) with [Stanford OVAL](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu), and wrote three chapters of the [Data Quality Fundamentals](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-quality-fundamentals/9781098112035/) textbook with O'Reilly Media.
