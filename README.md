I am an MSc candidate at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk) and
an inaugural Cosmos Fellow at the
[Laboratory for Human-Centered AI](https://hailab.ox.ac.uk/), supported by the
[Cosmos Institute](https://cosmos-institute.org/).

My current research addresses the space of questions like these:
- Can large language models reason?
- How can we build robust measures of intelligent behavior in machines?
- How can we ascribe cognitive concepts to AI systems in an epistemologically and
scientifically valid way?
- How does (and should) our ascription of these cognitive concepts change the shape of
our interactions with AI?

I'm interested in lots of other questions that I don't get to work on, like:
- How can decentralized consensus algorithms reshape our
[democratic inputs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531) or our
[Republic of Science](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41821550)?
- Where is decentralization in collective action a
[virtue](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/09/20/daos.html)? A
[vice](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)? Is collective action the
[ur problem](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)?
- Can science fiction help us
[better conceptualize](https://www.sciphijournal.org/index.php/2017/11/12/why-the-culture-wins-an-appreciation-of-iain-m-banks/)
the (im)possibility of post-envy societies?
- What explains the converging picture of geometric structures in
[thought](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/2532/Conceptual-SpacesThe-Geometry-of-Thought), 
[culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09288),
[semantics](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-03612-001), and
[transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19750)?

Previously, I studied [Philosophy](https://philosophy.stanford.edu) (BAH) and [Computer
Science](https://www.cs.stanford.edu) (BS) at Stanford University. I wrote a
[thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08900) about trustâ€”what it is, philosophically, and
what is required for a philosophically defensible account of trust in explainable AI
literature.

I was also a Founder in Residence at [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/),
worked at [Monte Carlo Data](https://www.montecarlodata.com) as a Founding Data
Scientist, did [NLP research](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.317/) with
[Stanford OVAL](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu), and wrote three chapters of the [Data
Quality
Fundamentals](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-quality-fundamentals/9781098112035/)
textbook with O'Reilly Media.
