I am:
- a DPhil (PhD) student in the [Reasoning with Machines Lab](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/research-groups/reasoning-with-machines-ai-lab/), supervised by [Adam Mahdi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=jUDSqzEAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk);
- an inaugural Cosmos Fellow at the [Laboratory for Human-Centered
  AI](https://hailab.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Philipp Koralus](https://www.koralus.net/) and supported by the [Cosmos
  Institute](https://cosmos-institute.org/).

My academic work addresses the space of questions like these:
- Do large language models have cognitive capabilities?
- How can we build valid measures of intelligent behaviour in machines?
- How can we ascribe cognitive concepts to AI systems in an epistemologically and
scientifically suitable way?
- How does (and should) our ascription of these cognitive concepts change the shape of
our interactions with AI?

Previously, I studied [Philosophy](https://philosophy.stanford.edu) (BAH) and [Computer
Science](https://www.cs.stanford.edu) (BS) at Stanford University. I wrote a
[thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08900) about trust—what it is, philosophically, and
what is required for a philosophically defensible account of trust in explainable AI
literature. More recently, I completed my MSc at the Oxford Internet Institute. My MSc
thesis addresses the more technical question of construct validity in large language
model evaluations (and should be publicly available soon!)

I was also a Founder in Residence at [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/),
worked at [Monte Carlo Data](https://www.montecarlodata.com) as a Founding Data
Scientist, did [NLP research](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.317/) with
[Stanford OVAL](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu), and wrote three chapters of the [Data
Quality
Fundamentals](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-quality-fundamentals/9781098112035/)
textbook with O'Reilly Media.
