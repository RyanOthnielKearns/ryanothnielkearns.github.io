I am:
- a DPhil (PhD) student in the [Reasoning with Machines Lab](https://oxrml.github.io/),
  supervised by [Adam Mahdi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=jUDSqzEAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate)
  at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk);
- an inaugural Cosmos Fellow at the
  [Laboratory for Human-Centered AI](https://hailab.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by
  [Philipp Koralus](https://www.koralus.net/) and supported by the
  [Cosmos Institute](https://cosmos-institute.org/).

I research evaluations of AI systems. Evaluations are how we discover and
characterise the space of intelligent behaviour in AI. I am concerned with building out
a metrology for this evaluation practice (a scientific study of the measurement tools).
So, you can think of my research as lens crafting, rather than astronomy—I build the
"telescopes for intelligence" rather than the intelligent systems themselves.

My academic work addresses the space of questions like these:
- Do modern AI systems have cognitive capabilities?
- How can we build valid measures of intelligent behaviour in machines?
- How can we ascribe cognitive concepts to AI systems in an epistemologically and
scientifically suitable way?
- How does (and should) our ascription of these cognitive concepts change the shape of
our interactions with AI?

Previously, I studied [Philosophy](https://philosophy.stanford.edu) (BAH) and [Computer
Science](https://www.cs.stanford.edu) (BS) at Stanford University. I wrote a
[thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08900) about trust—what it is, philosophically, and
what is required for a philosophically defensible account of trust in explainable AI
literature. More recently, I completed my MSc at the Oxford Internet Institute. My MSc
thesis addresses the more technical question of construct validity in large language
model evaluations (and should be publicly available soon!)

I was also a Founder in Residence at [Entrepreneurs First](https://www.joinef.com/),
worked at [Monte Carlo Data](https://www.montecarlodata.com) as a Founding Data
Scientist, did [NLP research](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.317/) with
[Stanford OVAL](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu), and wrote three chapters of the [Data
Quality
Fundamentals](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-quality-fundamentals/9781098112035/)
textbook with O'Reilly Media.
